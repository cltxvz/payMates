# **💸 PayMates**  
*"Easily split group expenses, track payments, and settle up — together!"*

## **🚀 Description:**  

**PayMates** is a lightweight, full-stack expense-splitting app that helps friends, roommates, travel buddies, and teams manage shared costs effortlessly. Create or join an event, add expenses, and let PayMates calculate who owes what. It’s your digital IOU notebook — but smarter, faster, and way easier to use!

- ✅ Create or join an event using a unique invite code.
- ✅ Add shared expenses and specify how they should be split (evenly or custom amounts).
- ✅ Track who owes who — with live balance summaries.
- ✅ Mark payments as "paid" to stay on top of what’s settled.
- ✅ Auto-deletes events (and data) after 7 days for privacy and simplicity.

Whether you're traveling with friends or splitting rent with roommates, **PayMates** keeps the math (and peace) in check.
